**Customer Segmentation Analysis:**

Segment stores or departments based on sales patterns, markdowns, and regional features.

Analyze segment-specific trends and characteristics.

**Market Basket Analysis:**

Although individual customer transaction data is not available, infer potential product associations within departments using sales data.

**Demand Forecasting:**

Build models to forecast weekly sales for each store and department.

Incorporate factors like CPI, unemployment rate, fuel prices, and store/dept attributes.

Explore short-term and long-term forecasting models.

**Impact of External Factors:**

Examine how external factors (economic indicators, regional climate) influence sales.

Incorporate these insights into the demand forecasting models.

**Personalization Strategies:**

Develop personalized marketing strategies based on the markdowns and store segments.

Propose inventory management strategies tailored to store and department needs.

**Segmentation Quality Evaluation:**

Evaluate the effectiveness of the customer segmentation.

Use metrics to assess the quality of segments in terms of homogeneity and separation.
